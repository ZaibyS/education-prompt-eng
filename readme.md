# Education Prompt Engineering Framework

## Overview
The `education-prompt-eng` repository provides a structured framework for developing comprehensive lesson plans using advanced instructional design methodologies. This framework was developed as part of a **custom GPT model in ChatGPT**, designed to assist Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in crafting structured and effective educational materials, even without prior experience in instructional design.

## Key Features
- **Custom GPT Integration**: Built using a specialized ChatGPT model tailored for instructional design.
- **Structured Lesson Plan Format**: Based on Understanding by Design (UbD), Bloom’s Taxonomy, and the 5E Model.
- **Guided Framework**: Step-by-step instructions to ensure quality and coherence in lesson plans.
- **SME Feedback Loop**: Interactive process for refinement and improvement.
- **Performance-Based Assessment**: Incorporates real-world tasks to measure learning outcomes.
- **Template Alignment**: Ensures consistency across lessons following best practices in instructional design.

## Repository Contents
- **`Context.pdf`** – Detailed framework for instructional design, including methodologies and best practices.
- **`Lesson Details Guidance.pdf`** – Guidelines on structuring lessons, including vocabulary, resources, and instructional strategies.
- **`Lesson Plan Template.pdf`** – Standardized format for lesson plans with predefined sections.
- **`Output.pdf`** – Example lesson plan output based on the framework.

## How to Use
1. **Review the Context**: Read `Context.pdf` to understand the instructional design framework.
2. **Follow the Lesson Plan Template**: Use `Lesson Plan Template.pdf` to structure lesson plans.
3. **Refer to the Guidance Document**: Consult `Lesson Details Guidance.pdf` for best practices.
4. **Iterate and Refine**: Develop lessons in stages, following the SME feedback loop for refinement.
5. **Assess Learning Outcomes**: Implement performance tasks and other evidence-based assessments.

## Lesson Plan Format
Each lesson plan is structured as follows:

### **Stage 1: Desired Results**
- **Learning Goals**: Categorized by cognitive levels (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating).
- **Understandings & Essential Questions**: Key insights and open-ended questions to encourage inquiry.

### **Stage 2: Evidence**
- **Performance Tasks**: Real-world applications to assess understanding.
- **Other Evidence**: Quizzes, observations, and discussions to complement assessments.

### **Stage 3: Learning Experiences & Instruction**
- **Engage**: Spark curiosity and connect prior knowledge.
- **Explore**: Hands-on activities to investigate key concepts.
- **Explain**: Direct instruction with structured explanations.
- **Elaborate/Extend**: Applying knowledge in new contexts.
- **Evaluate**: Performance-based assessments.
- **Wrap-Up & Homework**: Summarize learning and assign further exploration.
